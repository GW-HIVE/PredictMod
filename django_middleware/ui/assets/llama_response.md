**Types of Ovarian Cancer:**

1. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC): The most common type, accounting for 90% of cases.
2. Germ cell ovarian cancer (GCO): Originates from egg cells and typically affects younger women.
3. Stromal ovarian cancer (SOC): Originates from connective tissue and can produce hormones.

**Treatment Options:**

1. Surgery: Removal of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and surrounding tissue (called a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy).
2. Chemotherapy: Use of medications to kill cancer cells, often used in combination with surgery.
3. Radiation therapy: Use of high-energy rays to kill cancer cells, often used in combination with surgery or chemotherapy.
4. Targeted therapy: Use of medications that target specific molecules or pathways involved in cancer growth and progression.
5. Immunotherapy: Use of medications that stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells.

**Clinical Trials:**

1. Phase I: Initial testing of a new treatment to determine its safety and tolerability.
2. Phase II: Testing of a new treatment to determine its effectiveness in a larger population.
3. Phase III: Large-scale testing of a new treatment to compare its effectiveness to existing treatments.
4. Phase IV: Post-marketing surveillance of a new treatment to monitor its long-term safety and effectiveness.

**Other Key Terms:**

1. CA-125: A protein biomarker often used to monitor ovarian cancer recurrence and response to treatment.
2. BRCA1 and BRCA2: Genetic mutations associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer.
3. PARP inhibitors: A class of targeted therapies that target enzymes involved in DNA repair.
4. Platinum-based chemotherapy: A common type of chemotherapy used to treat ovarian cancer, including carboplatin and cisplatin.
5. Recurrent ovarian cancer: Cancer that has come back after initial treatment.
6. Maintenance therapy: Treatment given to patients with recurrent ovarian cancer to prevent further progression.

These terms should provide a good starting point for your research on the clinical treatment of ovarian cancer.
