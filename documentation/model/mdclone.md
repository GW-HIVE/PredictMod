# MDClone
Description: MDClone is a big data analytics platform that has a collaboration with the Veterans Affairs to provide synthetic patients that exhibit similar statistics to those of US veterans. Our objective is to extract prediabetes datasets with interventions like diet, exercise, and medication to train machine learning models for predicting response outcomes to these interventions. The following information provided in this document details our process for data preprocessing, algorithm selection, hyperparameters, model evaluation, and quality control. Additionally, the goal of this document is to highlight source code associated with each iteration of the MDClone model.
