# About
**About PredictMod:**  
Our goal is to provide clinicians with a powerful decision making tool that enhances clinical understanding of patient-level data. The PredictMod platform utilizes machine learning tools and complex datasets based on electronic health records, gut microbiome, and -omics data to forecast patient outcomes, often in response to treatment for a particular condition. While our primary condition of interest is Prediabetes, the tool is designed to be used for a variety of conditions, interventions, and data types.

**About HIVE Lab:**  
The HIVE Lab group is involved in developing the High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) which aims to integrate various high throughput data analysis tools for bioinformatics. In addition to the HIVE platform, the lab is involved in developing bioinformatics tools and resources, such as standards for bioinformatics communication, knowledgebases for glycoinformatics and infectious diseases, cancer research, and microbiome analysis.
