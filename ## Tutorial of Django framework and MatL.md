## Tutorial of Django framework and MatLab scripts
### Prerequisites
python and Node.js installed
### install Django
create a new virtual python environment in your computer(recommand but not nessassary)
```
python -m pip install django
```
check the version of django and make sure it was successfully installed
```python
import django
django.get_version()
```
Now we can use management tool 'django-admin' to create a new project
```
django-admin startproject prem
```
The python version and the MatLab version must be compatiable
In my working environment, I use R2022b with python 3.10
