# PredictMod
## Introduction
PredictMod is a web app created to inform physicians' decisions. PredictMod takes metagenomic gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome and electronic health record (EHR) data as input and uses a machine learning algorithm to form predictions of whether the ketogenic diet may be successful. 

The PredictMod web app was designed using Figma and implemented using VueJS. For more information on these, see the links below:
