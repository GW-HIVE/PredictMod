## Need
Accurate prediction of patient outcomes based on methylation data is critical for assessing the effectiveness of treatments, such as their potential to reduce tumor size in ovarian cancer. Class imbalance in such datasets can hinder the development of reliable predictive models.

## Method
This script processes methylation data from an Excel file to classify patient outcomes. It employs the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the dataset, followed by training a Random Forest classifier. The workflow includes feature preprocessing, train-test splitting, oversampling for minority classes, and model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, and a classification report.

## Results
The workflow demonstrates successful balancing of class distributions, enabling robust classification of patient outcomes. Key outputs include a trained classification model and associated feature names, stored for future analysis and deployment. The model achieves reliable performance metrics, supporting its use in clinical or research settings.

## How the Results Can Be Used/Interpreted
The trained model provides a tool for predicting whether a treatment is likely to reduce tumor size in ovarian cancer patients, based on methylation profiles. This supports clinical decision-making, biomarker discovery, and personalized medicine approaches by leveraging methylation data to evaluate therapeutic efficacy.

This usability domain emphasizes the purpose, methodology, and potential applications of the workflow, providing a clear scientific context and actionable insights.
