# Original submission from Karina did not include XGBoost version
# which presented breaking issues upon dockerization (after her
# departure). I've updated as best I can, and lock in the XGBoost 
# version here. There is an import warning, but the system appears
# to work correctly
xgboost==2.1.1
# NB - As of Mar 2024, there are 1256 open bugs reported on SHAP
# - they attempted to update the format of SHAP outputs between
#   0.44.2.dev34 to 0.45.0 and it broke all kinds of things. 
#   Easiest workaround is to have docker install v0.44.1
#   locally and run with that
# See: https://github.com/shap/shap/releases/tag/v0.45.0
