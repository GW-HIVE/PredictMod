# Data Preprocessing, Algorithm Selection, and Model Evaluation for Diabetes Classifier
## Data Source
Synthea ([https://www.mdclone.com](https://synthea.mitre.org/)) is a synthetic patient data platform that provides patient data without compromising personal patient information. This was used as a training set to generate a 1000 patient dataset for the diabetes EHR classifier and predictor 

## Training Dataset
The training dataset consists of 1000 patients and 8 variables.

## Intervention & Outcomes
- Responder Status: Patients diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes during doctor visits.
- Nonresponder Status: Patients not diagnosed with diabetes or prediabetes during doctor visits.

## Algorithm & Model Performance
Algorithm: Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
Model Accuracy: 91%
