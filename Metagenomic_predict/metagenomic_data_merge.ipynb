    "Performing Data Merge of Each Bacterial Organisms Relative Abundance Into a Single Spreadsheet \n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Urnisha Bhuiyan\n",
    "Date: January 17th, 2023\n",
    "Written in: Jupyter Notebooks \n",
    "Availability: https://github.com/GW-HIVE/PredictMod\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective\n",
    "After using the \"calculate_rel_abund.ipynb\" script to generate relative abundance for each sample, this code will: \n",
    "1) Extract the \"Reference\" and \"Relative Abundance\" columns from each sample file \n",
    "2) Rename the \"Relative Abundance\" column in each file to the respective sample name    \n",
    "3) Merge all sample columns into a single file called \"merged_table.csv\" based off of the \"Reference\" column. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Notes \n",
    "This code should be executed in the same folder containing all input csv files. Make sure each input file is named after it's respective sample to keep track of your data. This code will adjust your original input files, so make sure to keep a copy of the original files if you do not want to lose all other columns. \n"
